**Purpose**
ELIXIR-SI, in cooperation with the ELIXIR Train-The-Trainer subtask, will hold a Train the Trainer (TtT) event in connection with an "Introduction to the Linux command line" session. 


The learning objectives of the course consist of exploring, discussing and understanding four main themes: 

* [Learning principles and how they apply to training](./TtT_session_1.md)
* [Training techniques that can be used to enhance learner engagement and participation] (./TtT_session_2.md)
* [Session, course, and materials design] (./TtT_session_3.md)
* [Assessment and feedback in training] (./TtT_session_4.md)

The following day (Wednesday, 30th November) TtT participants will be able to act as observers and training assistants, and will attend an end-of-the-day recapitulation meeting where the effectiveness of the methods is assessed and discussed. They will be asked to prepare reports as assignments, to be returned in the two weeks after the course.

> ### Learning outcomes
> * Learners can tell which learning principles a good trainer should have in mind
> * Learners can describe at least three training techniques drawing on learning principles
> * Learners can design a training session and a course
> * Learners can develop assessment questionnaires
> * Learners can tell what types of material are needed for each part of a training session

### Session 1: Review of learning principles and how they apply to training

 * Terminology used in learning;
 * Learning aims, objectives and outcomes;
 * The Bloom's six categories of cognitive skills;
 * How learning works: research-based principles of learning and their implications for teaching practice;
 * What is formal and non-formal learning?
 * Relevant models from cognitive science;
 * Cognitive load.

### Session 2: Training techniques that can be used to enhance learner engagement and participation
 * Delivering a learning event as a mission; establishing learning mode, teamwork and mutual trust;
 * Teaching as a preformance art: promoting learner engagement;
 * The GOBLET skills matrix for trainers;
 * Motivation and demotivation;
 * Closed loop learning delivery;
 * Learning by doing;
 * Retention;
 * Priming; 
 * Self-confidence and usage independence;
 * Carpentry teaching practices (http://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/15-practices/);
 * The role of wrap-up sessions;

### Session 3: Session, course, and materials design
* Training session design and plan;
* From session to course design;
* Training rooms for Bioinformatics, Reproducibility of training environments;
* Training materials: designing, producing, delivering;
* Training materials: Archival; Sharing; Making re-use possible;
* Training materials repositories and resources: GOBLET, TeSS, GitHub, etc.
* Preparatory steps for training delivery;

### Session 4: Assessment and feedback in training
* Formative and summative assessment;
* Using questionnaires to promote peer instruction and content delivery;
* The role of questioning in learning; Formative Assessment;
* Diagnostic questionnaires
* Design of MCQs with distractors
* Assessment of training quality, participant and instructor performance;
* Systematic Feedback;
* (Short and long term) Post-course feedback.

# Ideas for Challenges:

  * Design a diagnostic questionnaire;
  * Plan a session;
  * Design a course schedule;
  * Draw a concept map for a session;
  * Prepare a mini-presentation (3-mins); video yourself while delivering it; watch the video; adjust the mini-session and run it again [notice that you have to find a topic that can be taught in 3 minutes; it could be from any field]
  * Collect responses dynamically using Socrative or Learning Catalytics;
  * Create a group discussion and its annotation;
  
---
> Challenge:
> * Read the Sofware Carpentry Instructor training document on [Concept maps](https://github.com/swcarpentry/instructor-training/blob/gh-pages/_episodes/08-memory.md)
> * If you want you can find further material on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_map)
> * Choose a topic that can be explained/taught in 3 minutes
> * Write Learning Objectives and Outcomes 
> * Draw a concept map
> * Make a 3 minute presentation (with or without slides)
> On Day 2, you will be videoed while presenting in group and receive feedback.
